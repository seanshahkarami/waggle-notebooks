# Jupyter Notebook Examples using Waggle Datasets

These are various notebooks and code I've found useful when exploring some of the Waggle datasets. Hopefully some of this is useful to you, too!

## Setup

All dependencies are listed in a standard requirements file. To install, just
run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

# you may need to explicitly use pip3, if you have python 2 and 3 installed.
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you should be able to open the notebook viewer in this directory:
```
jupyter-notebook
```
