# Jupyter Notebook Examples using Waggle Datasets

These are various notebooks and code I've found useful when exploring the data we've collected. Please feel free to use what's here.

## Setup

I just use Pandas for the data loading and processing, you can install it using:
```
# python 2
pip install pandas

# python 3
pip3 install pandas
```
