# Jupyter Notebook Examples using Waggle Datasets

These are various notebooks and code I've found useful when exploring some of the Waggle datasets. Hopefully some of this is useful to you, too!

## Setup

I just use Pandas for the data loading and processing, you can install it using:
```
# python 2
pip install pandas

# python 3
pip3 install pandas
```
