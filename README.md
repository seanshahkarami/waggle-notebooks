# Jupyter Notebook Examples using Waggle Datasets

This will house various notebooks and code I've found interesting or useful when exploring some of the data we've collected. Please feel free to use what's here - if it's helpful to you, then I consider it worthwhile. That being said, I need to provide a fair warning: Even though I work with the Waggle team, these should be considered my own, _personal_ explorations and experiments and not a stable interface / API to any of what's available publically.
